# EC601-project3

## Description
This part is going to write unit tests for project2. I totally wrote three unit tests. 

The first one is testing whether the output have correct form. Normally, the search term will appear in the output. If the test is correct, passed is printed; otherwise, failed is printed.

The second one is testing search function. Change the label or environment to see whether search function can work.

The last one is testing sentiment function. Give a negative sentence to test whether the sentiment function was correct.
